# 100_days_of_ml_code
The repository for my 100 Days of (Medical) ML Code challenge

I have a passion for medicine and deep learning, so focusing my 100 Days of ML Code challenge to medicine seemed like the natural thing to do.

## Day 0 - July 25, 2019
Set up a repository and perused medical datasets to begin with cleaning, EDA, and visualization projects. I eventually decided on starting with the arrhythmia dataset found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia <br>
I'm not certain what the greater project or application will be, I'll keep an open mind for now while working through some of the basics.
