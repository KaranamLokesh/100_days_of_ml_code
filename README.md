# 100_days_of_ml_code
The repository for my 100 Days of (Medical) ML Code challenge

I have a passion for medicine and deep learning, so focusing my 100 Days of ML Code challenge to medicine seemed like the natural thing to do.

## Day 0 - July 25, 2019
Set up a repository and perused medical datasets to begin with cleaning, EDA, and visualization projects. I eventually decided on starting with the arrhythmia dataset found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia <br>
I'm not certain what the greater project or application will be, I'll keep an open mind for now while working through some of the basics.

## Day 1 - July 26,  2019
Started a basic analysis of the dataset when I noticed one column had many missing values and decided to use the opportunity to highlight the effects of imputation and interpolation methods on the distribution.

## Day 2 - July 27, 2019
Cleaned the dataset, performed some basic EDA, demonstrated effects of PCA. Will consider training a simple regression model using the scikit-learn pipeline.
